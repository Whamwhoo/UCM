                    In the spring of 2013 UCM celebrated 20 years of ministry in Ukraine. It all started after one visit, during which our eyes were opened to the spiritual hunger and great material needs of the people in the Zolotonosha area.

                    During the years we have seen God at work in many remarkable and amazing ways. In 1993 we attended the opening of the Zolotonosha Baptist Church new building, built by the members themselves. Praise God now there are 20 or more churches in this area, some have their own building, others use rented premises, and others meet in homes. UCM continue to support some of these in different ways.

                    At the start of UCM, lorries carrying Humanitarian Aid were sent to Ukraine, but nowadays, because of local customs regulations it is not possible to do this. Through the local church in our villages, the Pastor or leader receive finance from UCM, which helps them to help their own people, as the need arises.

                    UCM continue to greatly rejoice in the goodness of the Lord, in His faithfulness to us through these years, for His help, strength and wisdom and for the continuing and abundant blessings which we receive. We praise the Lord for many willing volunteers who work hard for UCM in various ways especially the team of workers at AAE. UCM continue to trust and depend upon the Lord to supply our needs, through donations, Gift Aid etc. which are received from churches, groups and individuals. Gift Aid forms are available on request.
